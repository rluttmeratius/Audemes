                        <p>Pronounced "awe deems," they are brief audio illustrations that combine sound effects,
                        sometimes with music, to form aural symbols that signify various ideas, things, actions
                        and situations. For example, an Audeme combining the sound of a catâ€™s meow and a person
                        snoring could mean "Cat Nap". <br> <br> Since 2007 we have worked with blind and visually impaired students
                        and their teachers to develop audemes and audeme games. The results have been very encouraging.
                        Students who hear audemes presented with educational materials score significantly better in tests
                        of those materials than students who did not hear the audemes. And when students play audeme riddle
                        games based on chapters from standard science textbooks, they score significantly better in end-of-chapter
                        tests than in tests for chapters learned without audeme games. After a year of audeme game play, students
                        expressed significantly more positive subjective attitudes about science and science learning. These results
                        have helped our work generate grant funding from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust, Google Research Awards
                        and the National Science Foundation. <br> <br> This website offers a basic introduction to the whole idea of audemes and
                        audeme games. We believe we have just begun to explore the possibilities of audemes, audeme games and other
                        applications yet to be developed. We welcome your comments, questions and ideas.</p>
